## Nodes
(basic-node-tp)=
### True Positive
A true positive node is defined as a predicted node that matches to only one
ground truth node. Additionally, the corresponding ground truth node cannot be
matched to more than one predicted node. True positives are annotated on both
the ground truth and the division graph.

(basic-node-fp)=
### False Positive
A false positive node is a node on the predicted graph does not match to a
node on the ground truth graph. False positives are annotated on the predicted
graph.

```{code-cell} ipython3
plot_matched([ex_graphs.fp_edge_matched(1)], [{7: "FP", 8: "FP"}], "", [""])
```

(basic-node-fn)=
### False Negative
A false negative node is a node on the ground truth graph that is not matched
to a predicted node. False negatives are annotated on the ground truth graph.

```{code-cell} ipython3
plot_matched([ex_graphs.fn_node_matched(2)], [{3: "FN"}], "", [""])
```


## Edges
(basic-edge-tp)=
### True Positive
An edge in the ground truth is a true positive edge if both source and target
node are true positives and the corresponding edge is present in the
prediction. True positive edges are annotated on both the ground truth and the
predicted graph.

(basic-edge-fp)=
### False Positive
False positive edges occur in and are annotated on the predicted graph. A
false positive edge can occur in several different scenarios when the edge
fails to meet the criteria for a true positive.

- Ex 1: Nodes 7 and 8 are not matched to any node in the GT.
- Ex 2: While Nodes 5 and 6 are matched to nodes in the GT, an edge does not
  exist between the corresponding GT nodes 2 and 3.
- Ex 3: Node 6 is not matched to a node in the GT.


```{code-cell} ipython3
def fp_node_match():
    matched = ex_graphs.good_matched()
    matched.gt_graph.graph.remove_edge(2, 3)
    return matched


def fp_node_not_matched():
    matched = ex_graphs.good_matched()
    mapping = matched.mapping
    mapping.remove((3, 6))
    return Matched(matched.gt_graph, matched.pred_graph, mapping, {})
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
plot_matched(
    [
        ex_graphs.fp_edge_matched(1),
        fp_node_match(),
        fp_node_not_matched(),
    ],
    [{(7, 8): "FP"}, {(5, 6): "FP"}, {(5, 6): "FP"}],
    "",
    ["Ex. 1", "Ex. 2", "Ex. 3"],
)
```

(basic-edge-fn)=
### False Negative
A false negative edge can occur in the ground truth graph when:

- One or both of the nodes is not a true positive and matched to a node in the
  prediction
- The matched nodes in the prediction do not also have an edge between them

```{code-cell} ipython3
plot_matched(
    [
        ex_graphs.fn_edge_matched(0),
        ex_graphs.crossover_edge(),
        ex_graphs.fn_node_matched(0),
    ],
    [{(1, 2): "FN"}, {(1, 2): "FN", (4, 5): "FN", (5, 6): "FN"}, {(1, 2): "FN"}],
    "",
    ["", "", ""],
)
```

(basic-skip-edge)=
### Skip Edges
Under default behavior, {term}`skip edges <Skip Edges>` will be annotated as False Positive on the predicted graph
and False Negative on the ground truth graph unless both graphs contain an
identical skip edge. Similarly, {term}`skip edges <Skip Edges>` on the predicted
graph that do not exist in the ground truth graph will be annotated as False
Positive, with corresponding False Negative annotations on the ground truth.

- Ex 1: The {term}`skip edges <Skip Edges>` are identical, they will be marked TP.
- Ex 2: The GT skip edge is not present in the prediction. It is
  annotated as FN. Predicted edges are FP.
- Ex 3: The predicted skip edge is not present in the GT. It is
 annotated as FP. GT edges are FN.

```{code-cell} ipython3
plot_matched(
    [
        ex_graphs.gap_close_matched_gap(),
        ex_graphs.gap_close_gt_gap(),
        ex_graphs.gap_close_pred_gap(),
    ],
    [
        {},
        {(1, 3): "FN", (5, 6): "FP", (6, 7): "FP"},
        {(2, 3): "FN", (3, 4): "FN", (6, 8): "FP"},
    ],
    "",
    ["Ex. 1", "Ex. 2", "Ex. 3"],
)
```

{term}`Skip edges <Skip Edges>` can be handled more permissively by setting `relax_skips_gt=True` and/or `relax_skips_pred=True`. In this scenario, an edge `u -> v` can be matched to an edge `x -> y -> z` if the the endpoint nodes are matched and the intermediate node (`y`) is not matched.

By relaxing {term}`skip edges <Skip Edges>` on one or both of the graphs, the following cases can become correct. The skip edge itself will be annotated as a skip true positive (STP). Any matching edges on the opposite graph will also be annotated as STPs.

```{code-cell} ipython3
plot_matched(
    [
        ex_graphs.gap_close_gt_gap(),
        ex_graphs.gap_close_pred_gap(),
        ex_graphs.div_parent_gap()
    ],
    [
        {(1, 3): "STP", (5, 6): "STP", (6, 7): "STP"},
        {(2, 3): "STP", (3, 4): "STP", (6, 8): "STP"},
        {(9, 11): "STP", (9, 12): "STP", (2, 3): "STP", (3, 4): "STP", (3, 5): "STP"}
    ],
    "",
    ["relax_skips_gt=True", "relax_skips_pred=True", "relax_skips_pred=True"],
)
```
